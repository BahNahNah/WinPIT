[WinPIT README]
---------------

Windows Process Injection Toolkit aka WinPIT, is a tool that was
concieved in order to truly have a broad spectre of options regarding
process injection at any architecture thats possible to actually
inject into.

I will not ever include any detailed information towards each feature
that the tool holds - wether it be the actual internal code, or the
GUI accessible functions. It is a pretty simple straight-outta-the-box
tool, so if you are not able to use it - maybe you shouldn't even have
it - that simple!

PS:
There are a few limitations towards who may be able to run this tool;

1: User MUST use a multi-core CPU due to threading usage...
2: User MUST run a modern version of Windows (kinda says itself)...
3: User MUST be aware that there is NO warranties in using this tool,
   some of the methods involved in this tool may actually cause harm
   if not used properly!

Credits are due where credits are due, no greets and no regrets!
