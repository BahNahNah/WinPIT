[WinPIT README]
---------------

Windows Process Injection Toolkit aka WinPIT, is a tool that was
concieved in order to truly have a broad spectre of options regarding
process injection at any architecture thats possible to actually
inject into.

I will not ever include any detailed information towards each feature
that the tool holds - wether it be the actual internal code, or the
GUI accessible functions. It is a pretty simple straight-outta-the-box
tool, so if you are not able to use it - maybe you shouldn't even have
it - that simple!

Credits are due where credits are due, no greets and no regrets!
